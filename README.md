Downloading TikTok videos is a common practice for many users who want to save their favorite clips or share them with others. However, not all videos can be downloaded directly from the app, and some may require third-party tools or websites. In this article, we will show you how to download any TikTok video using different methods, depending on your device and preferences.

Method 1: Download videos from the app

This is the easiest and most official way to [download TikTok video](https://cybertiktok.com/), but it only works for videos that have the "Save video" option enabled by the creator. To check if a video can be downloaded this way, follow these steps:

- Open the TikTok app and find the video you want to download.
- Tap on the "Share" icon at the bottom right corner of the screen.
- Look for the "Save video" option in the menu that appears. If you see it, tap on it and wait for the video to be saved to your device's gallery or camera roll. If you don't see it, it means that the creator has disabled this option and you will need to use another method.
- You can also download your own videos by tapping on the "Me" icon at the bottom right corner of the screen, then tapping on the video you want to download, and following the same steps as above.

Method 2: Download videos using a screen recorder

This method works for any video, regardless of whether it has the "Save video" option or not, but it may result in lower quality or unwanted sounds. To download TikTok videos using a screen recorder, follow these steps:

- Open the TikTok app and find the video you want to download.
- Swipe up from the bottom of your screen (or swipe down from the top if you have an iPhone X or later) to access the Control Center. Tap on the "Screen Recording" icon to start recording your screen. If you don't see this icon, you may need to add it to your Control Center first by going to Settings > Control Center > Customize Controls and tapping on the "+" button next to Screen Recording.
- Go back to the TikTok app and play the video you want to download. Make sure to adjust the volume and mute any notifications or sounds that may interfere with the recording.
- When the video is over, swipe up from the bottom of your screen (or swipe down from the top if you have an iPhone X or later) to access the Control Center again. Tap on the "Screen Recording" icon to stop recording your screen. The recorded video will be saved to your device's gallery or camera roll.
- You can edit or trim the video as you wish using any video editing app or tool.

Method 3: Download videos using a third-party website

This method also works for any video, but it requires an internet connection and may involve some risks such as malware or privacy issues. To download TikTok videos using a third-party website, follow these steps:

- Open the TikTok app and find the video you want to download.
- Tap on the "Share" icon at the bottom right corner of the screen.
- Look for the "Copy link" option in the menu that appears and tap on it. This will copy the URL of the video to your clipboard.
- Open a web browser on your device and go to a website that allows you to download TikTok videos, such as tiktokdownloader.com, musicallydown.com, or snaptik.app. Be careful when choosing a website and make sure it is safe and reliable.
- Paste the URL of the video into the input box on the website and tap on the "Download" button. The website will process your request and generate a download link for you.
- Tap on the download link and choose where you want to save the video on your device. The downloaded video will be saved to your device's gallery or camera roll.

These are some of the methods you can use to download TikTok videos. However, before downloading any video, make sure you respect the rights and privacy of the original creators and do not use their content for any illegal or unethical purposes.
